# is it a keycard

A website that keeps track of all Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key Cards. Learn more about them by reading the official support document [here](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415/~/nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-game-key-card-overview). The goal of this project is to provide easy access to information on Game-Key Cards that will help an user to assess whether the game they are purchasing is fully present on the cartridge or not, should they choose to get a physical copy.

Video games on this list do not contain any game on the cartridge instead it merely acts as an authentication mechanism prompting the user to download the game when inserted into their devices. 

This is a growing list that will be updated periodically. If there are any discrepancies in the information provided or if there are any bugs/glitches please open an issue [here](github.com/toomanypixels/isitakeycard/issues).
